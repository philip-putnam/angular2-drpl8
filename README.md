# Drupal 8 + Angular 2, using Angular-CLI

By: Philip Putnam

## Anguarl 2 side, using Angular-CLI

# Planning

1. npm install -g @angular/cli
2. bower install bootstrap --save
3. npm install node-sass --save-dev
4. ng set defaults.styleExt scss (or ng new <project-name> --style=sass)

## Setup

This setup instruction requires drush & composer on the command line

This setup/github works in conjunction with a "partner" github that contains the Drupal 8 files, you will need to download both projects and place them in the same parent directory.

Drupal 8 files: https://github.com/philip-putnam/drupal8-CORS
Angular 2 files: https://github.com/philip-putnam/angular2-drpl8

1. npm install
2. bower install
